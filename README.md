# Bank Marketing Campaigns Analysis

## Overview
This analysis compares LogisticRegression, KNeigborghsClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, and SVM (support vectors machine) clasification algorithms in terms of the time they take to be trained and their accuracy when predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a bank term deposit.

## Data
The data was obtained from a Portuguese bank. The bank executed 17 marketing campaigns that occurred between May 2008 and November 2010, corresponding to a total of 79,354 contacts.

Refer to this [paper](/CRISP-DM-BANK.pdf) for more details about the origin of the data used for this analysis.
